### **1. Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road 
  - Does the pipeline for line identification take road images from a video as input and return an annotated video stream as output? (CHECK)
  - Has a pipeline been implemented that uses the helper functions and / or other code to roughly identify the left and right lane lines with either line segments or solid lines? (example solution included in the repository output: raw-lines-example.mp4) (CHECK)
  - Have detected line segments been filtered / averaged / extrapolated to map out the full extent of the left and right lane boundaries? (example solution included in the repository: P1_example.mp4) (CHECK)

### **2. Reflection**

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
